# Getting Started with Roll & Reflect

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This was my capstone project to complete my Web Development Diploma at BrainStation. This is an ongoing proejct of mine, as it is something I would like to see other users to benefit from, it's just not there, YET. 

This is a learning tracking app for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu where users are able to input their learning along with a video of their practice. 
Being able to watch yourself in motion in sports is important as it allows one to narrow in on focus points. 

There was not dataset or API available that I had the information I wanted to build this application, and with that there are opportunities for the community to add to the database to continue to educate other members.
